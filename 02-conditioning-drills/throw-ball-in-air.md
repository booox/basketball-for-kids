# Throw Ball in Air & Catch

* In this drill the players stand facing the coach, holding their basketball with both hands, waist high.
* On the coachâ€™s command:
	*  the players throw the ball up in the air and then catch it.
* Have the players start by throwing the ball up only a foot or two into the air. 

* Once they master this, have the players increase the height of the throw.
