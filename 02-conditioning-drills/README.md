# Coordination & Conditioning Drills


> Basketball is a sport of constant motion.  
> If a player is not in the proper condition, 
> 	* they will find 
> 	* it difficult to keep up with other players, 
> 	* and the offense and especially defense will suffer.  
> It is essential that your players be in good physical condition.  
> While many younger players can run all day long and seem to never get tired, many children today are out of shape.  
> Conditioning should be part of every practice.
